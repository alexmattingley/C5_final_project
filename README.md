# C5_final_project
As a surfer I am always looking at raw data about wind and waves in order to make an informed decision about where I will surf on any given day. If you take a look at the websites that are out there now that cater to surfers, the focus is really on the analysis of raw data and telling people what they should or shouldnâ€™t think with only a little bit of access to raw data and information. This ultimately leads to inaccuracies in forecasting which create all sorts of problems.

The purpose of this site is to bring pertinent raw data for surfers all into a single application. A given person will be able to log into the site and see a set of data that is relevant to the location that they live in, and then they will eventually be able to customize that data to be relevant to their interests. This will allow surfers to make better decisions about where and when to surf.

##Scope

###v1.0 (finished 11/2/2015)

Site displays realtime buoy, tide, wind, water temperature,  and weather information for major surfing areas in southern California, including San Diego, Orange County, Los Angeles County, Ventura County, Santa Barbara County.

Site is entirely mobile first, one of the biggest pitfalls of modern surfing sites, is the lack of accessibility on a phone.

Detailed explanations of how how certain conditions effect certain areas. I want the site to be educational for people who are new the sport.

###v1.5

A surfer would be able to create an account and then customize the data that he or she sees to make it relevant to their specific location.

The ability to log information from a given day and time. This information would stay in your account and be private to you. It would allow you to reference that information in the future so you could make informed decisions on where to surf on a given day.

###v2.0

Allow a user to set up a text message or email alert if certain conditions are met. So basically a user could select that they want to receive a text message at 6:00 am (or any time for that matter) if the conditions are what they need to be, saving the hassle of getting up in the morning and checking six different web sites for the information that they are looking for.

###V2.5

Increase accuracy of buoy information to include swell breakdowns. Increase the number of locations to encompass Central and Northern California.
